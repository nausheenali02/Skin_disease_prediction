🧬 Skin Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered web application capable of predicting multiple skin diseases from dermoscopic images. The system leverages deep learning with transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques to classify skin conditions and assist in early detection for academic and decision-support purposes.
